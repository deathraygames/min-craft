# Min-craft 1975 - on the OWLBAT

Min-craft is a small web game made for [Retro Jam 2021](https://itch.io/jam/retro-jam-2021). Min-craft is inspired by Notch's Minicraft (Ludum Dare 22) and is an answer to the question: "What if Minecraft had been envisioned in 1975?"

OWLBAT *(Open Web Linked Browser-based Anachronistic Terminal)* is a fantasy computer based on the [PLATO computer system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLATO_(computer_system)) circa the 1970's and 80's. More info: https://github.com/rocket-boots/OWLBAT 

This repository is back-up fork of OWLBAT v0.5.0, so that min-craft can be preserved despite future changes to OWLBAT.
